     SCIENCE-GROUNDED SKILL IMPLEMENTATION
============================================

Hello! You've been asked to implement a Claude Code skill that prevents
scientific hallucinations by requiring verified sources.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------
1. READ "IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md" COMPLETELY before starting
2. SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT - implement all safety features
3. TEST EACH COMPONENT individually before integration
4. Build in this exact order:
   - paper_utils.py (with safety features)
   - field_detector.py
   - semantic_scholar_search.py
   - other search scripts one by one
   - SKILL.md (last!)

SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------
- Rate limit ALL API calls (2+ seconds)
- Validate/sanitize ALL user input
- Log ALL external requests
- Implement timeouts (10s max)
- Cache results (24h TTL)
- Never expose API keys

TESTING:
--------
After building each script, test it:
  python scripts/[scriptname].py "test query"

The user specifically wants you to TEST AS YOU GO.
Show them the output of each test before proceeding.

FILES TO READ:
-------------
1. IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - Complete technical specification
2. INFORMAL_NOTES.md - Context about the user's research
3. requirements.txt - Python dependencies

Good luck! Remember: accuracy > speed, safety > features

Questions? The user works on computational neuroscience for epilepsy,
focusing on seizure prediction using signal processing and ML.
